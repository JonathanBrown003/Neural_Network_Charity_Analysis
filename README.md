## Overview 
The purpose of this neural network analysis was to predict success or not for applicants applying for charity grants. The neural network analyzed over 34,000 organizations to predict if the charity was likely to have success or not. The more favorable companies would have a better opportunity to receive funding from Alphabet Soup.
